Grid Security Certificate Notes:

Certicate authority certificates include the following:

 - ffffffff.0 - cert
 - ffffffff.signing_policy

These need to installed on the server at /etc/grid-security/certificates.
These need to be installed on the client at ~/.globus.


Where do user certs go?

Client:  ~/.globus/usercert.pem
         ~/.globus/userkey.pem


# make client cert
openssl genrsa -out ~/.globus/userkey.pem 1024
openssl req -new -key ~/.globus/userkey.pem -out ~/.globus/usercert_request.pem -subj "/C=US/ST=North Carolina/L=Chapel Hill/O=Grid/CN=user1"

# sign client cert
echo globus  | grid-ca-sign -in ~/.globus/usercert_request.pem -out ~/.globus/usercert.pem
