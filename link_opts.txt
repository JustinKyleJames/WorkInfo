LD_LIBRARY_PATH            - runtime environment variable to search for library files
-l<l1>                     - at link time load library libl1
-L                         - at link time set the library path

-Wl,-rpath,$(DEFAULT_LIB_INSTALL_PATH)        - set the runtime path to find the libarary
nm -gC <library>                              - list symbols in library

static vs dynamic linking
--------------------------
g++ file.cpp -o out -Wl,-Bstatic -lsomestaticlib -Wl,-Bdynamic

  - links somestaticlib as static, others are dynamic
